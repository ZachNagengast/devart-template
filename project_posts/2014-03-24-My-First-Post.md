##The Beginning

The seed of inspiration for this project came from a device called the [Estimote Beacon](http://estimote.com/). The design was very compelling to me. The idea then brewed in my mind for several months before any code was even started. It intially progressed in the following stages using pure javascript.

- Create a single triangle "by hand"
- Create a row of several triangles connected to each other "by hand"
- Create this row algorithmically
- Move downward to make a square block
- Allow arbitrary inputs
- Design for user interaction and customization

Now for the fun stuff.
