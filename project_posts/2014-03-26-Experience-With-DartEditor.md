##A New Platform

Dart is a really new platform and deserves some slack because of this. Here's my experience so far.

- Selection: Highlighting text was difficult due to finicky behavior.

- Debugging: This is one of my favorite things so far, debugging for the web can be difficult, but DartEditor told me exactly where things were going wrong, which made things go much smoother.

- Syntax: Yes the syntax is somewhat different than javascript, but has similarites with other languages as well. To me it seems like took the best parts of many languages and put them into one.

I expected learning Dart to be painful, but it's been a breeze so far.
